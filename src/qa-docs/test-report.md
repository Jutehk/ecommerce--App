## 1. ðŸ“Œ Executive Summary
The goal of this testing cycle was to ensure that the **E-Commerce Product Filter App** functions correctly, meets business requirements, and provides a smooth user experience.  

We applied **Manual Testing, Jest Unit Testing, React Testing Library (Component Testing), and Cypress End-to-End Testing**. All tests passed successfully, and the product is considered **ready for release** with only minor improvements noted.

## 2. ðŸŽ¯ Objectives & Scope
- Validate **functional correctness** of filters, sorting, and product display.  
- Verify **UI/UX consistency** across devices.  
- Ensure **input validation** (boundary values, invalid ranges).  
- Confirm **integration flows** (category + price + sorting combined).  
- Check for **defects, usability gaps, and performance bottlenecks**.  

**In-Scope:** Product filter UI, category filters, price range, sorting, responsiveness.  
**Out-of-Scope:** Backend services, payment systems, third-party integrations.
